# SnowSakura: Physical Layer Implementation Specs for 15EG
## Target: 31.5ns Deterministic Latency for HKEX-OMD-C

### Physical Layer Design Philosophy

* **Determinism over Abstraction**: In the realm of 31.5ns latency, standard software stacks are nothing but propagation noise.
* **Hardware Sovereignty**: We bypass OS kernels, PCIe overhead, and standard IP blocks. Logic is mapped directly to the **GTH Transceiver** and dedicated **LUT** resources via manual routing.
* **Timing is Law**: Every clock cycle at 322.26MHz counts. If your logic takes more than 10 cycles, you've already lost the trade.

## The Physical Truth of Zero-Jitter Trading

In HFT, software architecture is an illusion; only **Physical Layer Logic** dictates the outcome. The following logs document the three-stage manual routing and timing closure process for a 31.5ns OMDC parser. 

Relying on Vivado's Auto-Router for OMD-C parsing is a death sentence. To squeeze latency down to 31.5ns, every **LUT**, every **Register**, and every **Routing path** must be manually constrained via precise XDC definitions.

### Stage 1: Datapath Routing & Net Delay Suppression

*![Weixin Image_20260318204056_4_26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d9c97f71-b2dd-4a0b-ab1d-b9e36a9b5e23)*


The raw battle between **Logic Delay** and **Net Delay**. When operating in the `gt_txusrclk2` domain at 322MHz, the propagation delay across the silicon is your biggest enemy.
* **Observation**: We manually forced the **Net Delay** to converge around 1.5ns - 1.6ns, keeping the **Logic Delay** strictly under 1ns (e.g., 0.973ns). 
* **Logic**: If you let the GUI decide your Placement, your Net Delay will spike, and your 31.5ns target will be shattered by routing congestion.

### Stage 2: Floorplanning & Initial Timing Closure

* ![Weixin Image_20260318204058_5_26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/914102f8-78b1-4161-87de-6fe76e48c760)*

Initial logic mapping and physical isolation. 
* **Timing Met**: **WNS (Worst Negative Slack)** secured at **0.708 ns**. **WHS (Worst Hold Slack)** tightly locked at **0.024 ns**.
* **Logic**: The logic cells (CLEM) are tightly packed to minimize interconnect latency. This is not arbitrary; this is the result of strict **Pblock** constraints. Zero failing endpoints mean the Triple-FF synchronization logic is physically solid.

### Stage 3: Full Pipeline Squeeze @ 322MHz

*![Weixin Image_20260318204100_6_26](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/22b17bb2-21c9-4b91-9fdb-dabb24aca638)*

As the parsing logic scales, the timing window shrinks to its absolute physical limit.
* **Timing Met**: **WNS** squeezed to **0.472 ns**, **WHS** at **0.030 ns**. 
* **Logic**: 0 Failing Endpoints across 542 endpoints. This proves the deterministic stability of the manual routing pipeline. We are pushing the Ultrascale+ architecture to its extreme edge without violating setup/hold times.

### Proprietary Disclaimer
**Do not ask for the XDC scripts.** The exact coordinates, `set_property LOC/BEL` mappings, and Phase Interpolator calibration values are proprietary and isolated in private labs. What you see here is the physical result; the manual routing logic behind it remains classified.
